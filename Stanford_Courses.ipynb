As this seminar will investigate, softness is intrinsically tied to the creative process, to the challenges of visualization and art making. What does it mean for a sculptor to depict fingers digging into marble flesh? How did the painter rise to the challenge of depicting subtle forms - clouds, atmosphere, the beating pulse, hair and animal fur? Why were some of the first histories of art relayed as the progression from hard to soft forms? Through the investigation of the concepts and artworks of artists such as Leonardo, Giorgione, Raphael, Correggio, and Bernini, this seminar will explore softness as an aesthetic category. Materiality, enlivenment, perfection and imperfection in art theory, old-age style, and the ekphrastic tradition will be topics of particular interest.

      "Quantum computers can solve some classes of problems with more efficiency than classical computers, usually exponentially faster. They have the potential to solve in minutes problems that would take for a classical computer longer than the age of the universe. Among the promising applications are the development of new drugs, and new materials, machine learning and cryptographic key breaking, just to mention a few examples. Until recently the idea of building a computer seemed like a project reserved for a distant future, but over the past years many companies such as IBM, Google, Microsoft, D-Wave, Rigetti Computing, and others have announced that they started the operation of quantum computer prototypes. However, due to the counterintuitive properties of quantum theory the creation of quantum algorithms has been as difficult as hardware development. Although there are many algorithms built to run on quantum computers there are very few that use the full potential of quantum computing. The purpose of this course is to teach the fundamentals of quantum computing and quantum algorithms for students with non-physics background. The emphasis of the course will be to develop a \"quantum intuition\" by presenting the main differences between classical and quantum logic, as well as the use of special examples developed in quantum cognition. Quantum cognition applies the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics in psychology and decision theories in situations where conventional formalism does not work. The topics covered will include: the basics of quantum theory and quantum computation, Classical and Quantum Logic, Classical and Quantum gates, Quantum Cognition, the main Quantum algorithms such as Phil's Algorithm, Deutsch Algorithm, Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm, Simon's algorithm, Shor's Algorithm, and Grover's Algorithm.

      "It has become common for us to see in the media news about computer winning a masters in chess, or answering questions on the Jeopardy TV show, or the impact of AI on health, transportation, education, in the labor market and even as an existential threat to mankind. This interest in AI gives rise questions such as: Is it possible for a computer to think? What is thought? Are we computers? Could machines feel emotions or be conscious? Curiously, there is no single, universally accepted definition of Artificial Intelligence. However in view of the rapid dissemination of AI these questions are important not only for experts, but also for all other members of society. This course is intended for students from different majors Interested in learn how the concept of intelligent machine is understood by the researchers in AI. We will study the evolution of AI research, its different approaches, with focus on the tests developed to verify if a machine is intelligent or not. In addition, we will examine the philosophical problems associated with the concept of intelligent machine. The topics covered will include: Turing test, symbolic AI, connectionist AI, sub- symbolic Ai, Strong AI and Weak AI, Ai singularity, unconventional computing, rationality, intentionality, representation, machine learning, and the possibility of conscious machines.\n",

The interplay between the multiple objectives of modeling the data, personalization, and decision optimization has created a number mathematical models that the course aims to cover. Examples of topics include graphical models and message-passing algorithms, high-dimensional and tensor models, and multi-armed bandits.\n",

      "The novelist and philosopher Leo Tolstoy pioneered ideas of multi-perspectivism, relativism, \"contagious\" art, and literary montage. How can we analyze the link between his prose fiction and modernist art by means of digital humanities methods? This course is arranged as a series of digital labs and seminar discussions and utilizes a project-based learning approach, with individual and collaborative projects. We create character networks in Gephi, side-by-side visualization of different versions of Tolstoy's texts in Beyond Compare, and text mining in RStudio. Taught in English.

      "How can data be used as ¿material¿ in art and design projects. Beyond straight-forward ideas of ¿data-visualization¿, this studio course seeks to investigate how we construct meaning from sets of information, and how the construction of those sets determines the meaning itself. This course also investigates different display aesthetics and how this is also a strategy for generating meaning. Artists studied include those who use various forms of personal, public, and social data as part of their practice. Historical examples from conceptual artists and other genres are considered along with contemporary artists working with data in digital or hybrid digital/physical formats.\n",

      "Over the past ten years, linguists have become increasingly interested in testing theories with a wider range of empirical data than the traditionally accepted introspective judgments of hand-selected linguistic examples. Consequently, linguistics has seen a surge of interest in psycholinguistic methods across all subfields. This course will provide an overview of various standard psycholinguistic techniques and measures, including offline judgments (e.g., binary categorization tasks like truth-value judgments, Likert scale ratings, continuous slider ratings), response times, reading times, eye-tracking, ERPs, and corpus methods. A particular focus will be placed on a problem that runs through all measures and techniques: that of generating an appropriate linking hypothesis from theoretical predictions to an expected empirical response pattern. Students will discuss research articles and gain hands-on experience with experimental design and implementation, data management, analysis, and visualization in R.\n",

Students will engage in statistical computing and visualization with current data analytic software (Jupyter, R). The objectives of this course are to have students (1) be able to connect data to underlying phenomena and to think critically about conclusions drawn from data analysis, and (2) be knowledgeable about programming abstractions so that they can later design their own computational inferential procedures. No programming or statistical background is assumed. Freshmen and sophomores interested in data science, computing and statistics are encouraged to attend. Open to graduates as well.\n",

Probability provides the foundation for modeling uncertainties. Statistics provides techniques for interpreting data, permitting managers to use small amounts of information to answer larger questions. In statistics, we focus on the linear regression model. Regression analysis provides a method for determining the relationship between a dependent variable and predictor variables. We introduce topics from non-linear models and machine learning model selection. Students taking this course need to be comfortable with mathematical notation, algebra, some calculus, and be open to learning to write short programs in statistical software (eg R or Stata). If you are not confident with your quantitative abilities, then you should enroll in OIT 265. Accelerated D&D will cover material covered in OIT 265 plus some additional topics such as discrete dependent variable models. While OIT 267 focuses on real world applicability, we will explore the mathematical underpinnings of these topics in more depth than OIT 265 as an avenue for deeper understanding. The group regression project is a key component of the course.\n",
